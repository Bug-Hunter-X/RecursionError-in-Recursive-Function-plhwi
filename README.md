This repository contains a Python function that exhibits a common error: RecursionError. The bug arises when the function makes too many recursive calls, exceeding the maximum recursion depth allowed by Python. The solution demonstrates how to refactor the recursive function into an iterative approach using a loop, thus avoiding the stack overflow issue. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.
